# DataSciencePoject

# Introduction
  The objective of our project was to practice visualizing data in Python. Specifiaclly we wanted to look at data conerning videogames sales to see if we could create charts to answer the three questions we had. Those question were (put questions here)


# Selection of Data
  All data manipualtion was done in a Juypter notebook (link to notebook here later)

  The data was taken from a set found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings)
  
  The data has 16 characteristics: Name, Platform, Year_of_Release, Genre, Publisher, NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, Other_Sales, Global_Sales, Critic_Score, Critic_Count, User_Score, User_Count, Developer, and Rating
  
  After looking through the data, we realzied that many of our data points had incomplete infromation. We decided the best way to deal with this was to simply remove any data entry that was missing information. This took our data sample down from a size of roughly 16000 to 6000, which we felt was still enough of a smaple size to anser our questoins.
